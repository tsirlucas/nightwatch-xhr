Protractor XHR

We've encountered some issues with our e2e tests.
We tried checking if clicks on specific links behave as they should (which also meant, send a POST XHR request to a tracking server).

Since we couldn't find any package for that, we wrote one.

So - this package waits for XHR to complete and enables a callback with its values for assertion.

Have fun!

Install
---
```shell
npm install protractor-xhr
```

or 

```shell
yarn add protractor-xhr
```

## Commands 

### waitForNextXHR
Calls the `trigger`, and then calls `callback` with the first xhr request corresponding to the given `urlPattern`, failing if `timeout` is exceeded.  

## Usage Examples
The function expects these parameters:
* urlPattern - a regex match for url pattern, will only listen to urls matching this, use '' for all urls.
* timeout - well, timeout
* callback - use this to assert the request after it completes

### waitForNextXHR:
```javascript
module.exports = {
    'Catch next XHRs': function () {
        waitForNextXHR('/some/path/regex/', 1000).then(function(xhrs) {
            expect(xhrs.length > 0).toBe(true);
        })
    }
 }
```

### waitForNextXHR (async/await):
```javascript
module.exports = {
    'Catch next XHRs': async function () {
        const xhrs = await waitForNextXHR('/some/path/regex/', 1000);
        expect(xhrs.length > 0).toBe(true);
    }
 }
```

The promise returns an array of objects containing the following properties :
* method (GET/POST)
* url (url of request)
* httpResponseCode (HTTP status response code, eg: "200")

When the anticipated XHR request has not occurred, it fails an assertion. Callback is not called and an error will be thrown

most of the code with their library. This one is just a fork adapted to Protractor.
